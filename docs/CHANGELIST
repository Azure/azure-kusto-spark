Version 0.1 (baseline):
- Add a data sink connector, supporting standard 'write' operations ('writeStream' interface is also supported)
- Add a basic data source connector, supporting standard 'read' operations
  Note: in this version, a single partition is forced

Version 0.2:
- Fix DataTypes support, including DateTime and decimal
- Fix streaming sink when working with multiple batches. Handle empty batches
- Add 'KUSTO_WRITE_RESULT_LIMIT' option. When writing to Kusto, limits the number of rows read back as BaseRelation
- Adjust to Spark 2.4. This is optimized for Azure DataBricks default. In order to use with Spark 2.3, pom.xml
  file must be adjusted: spark.version (to 2.3.x) and json4s-jackson_2.11 (to 3.2.11)
- KustoOptions.KUSTO_TABLE is no longer used in reading using kusto source
